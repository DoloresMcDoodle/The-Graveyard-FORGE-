             Welcome to The Graveyard Config!
             //
             // Here, you can disable structures to spawn, change their chance of spawning, change their separation and also change their salt.
             // Additionally, you can turn the graveyard fog particles on and set the chance of spawning them (higher numbers = lower chance of spawning).
             // Graveyard fog particles spawn in graveyards and add an atmospheric and spooky element while exploring.
             //
             // To disable a structure to spawn, simply go to the corresponding entry and set `enabled` to false.
             //
             // The Graveyard uses the vanilla structure spawning system. That is -
             // - Separation is the minimum chunks between structures
             // - Spacing is the average chunks between structures (Spacing value needs to be higher than Separation value!)
             // - Salt is a special field that gives structures unique spawning positions. (Only change if you know what you are doing!)
             //
             // Notice: reducing the generation settings will increase the risk of structures overlapping. Especially jigsaw structures are unpredictable!
